I'm going to try removing tracks that start from the outside of the cluster, then
recalculate cluster sizes and slow/fast sizes.

There are two ways to define tracks that start from outside the cluster.
(1) tracks whose start are outside of the 50%-threshold KDE polygon
(2) tracks that diffused into the proposed Voronoi polygon

I'm testing #1 first... 

I think it's easiest to do this by modifying measure_cluster_props.m
to introduce new measures. We'll therefore need to re-run the pipeline
from that point
