Folder explanations:
- `CAtagSrc_vs_Binder_analysis` was a control to demonstrate that cluster size differences were not due to experimental or analytical artifacts. (Fig. S6P).
- `diffuse_in_analysis` was a control to demonstrate that the slow/fast diffusional structure was not attributable to molecules diffusing into the cluster laterally along the plasma membrane.
- `estimate per-cluster fraction time track present` was used to computer quantities necessary for the cluster kinetics analysis (specifically, the cluster binding/unbinding times).
- `update_adhesion_density_analyses` was used for updating the main text adhesion density/recruitment analyses (Fig. 5D)
- `vary_nMinTrk` repeated the cluster analyses, but varied the minimum number of tracks needed to define a cluster. This was used as both a control (Fig. S6N) and as a constraint for the cluster dynamics model (Fig. S6G).
