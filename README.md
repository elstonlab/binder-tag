# binder-tag


__Contains:__ code and examples for performing analyzing clusters from single particle tracking (SPT) maps (`cluster_analysis`), as well as for analyzing regulatory kinetics from tagSrc/Binder SPT co-diffusion events (`kinetics_analysis`). The diffusional dynamics analysis is currently a key component of the cluster analysis pipeline, but can be done independently from the cluster analysis, which is why it has its own folder (`diffusional_dynamics`).

__Does not contain:__ methods for detecting or fitting centroids of single particles from raw imaging data; methods for linking sets of centroids into tracks; methods for detecting the co-diffusion events; ...
