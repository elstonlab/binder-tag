The equations for modeling cluster dynamics (Methods: <b><i> Validation of cluster identification criterion </b></i> and <b><i> Stochastic model for cluster kinetics</b></i>) were computed analytically using Mathematica; the code is provided in a notebook in `analytic_equations`.

The numerical simulations for modeling cluster kinetics are provided in `numerical_simulation`, and are written in Python. The data used to fit the model is also provided within this folder.
